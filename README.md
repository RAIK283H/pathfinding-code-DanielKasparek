# Pathfinding Starter Code
Random Pathing Algorithm
The random pathing algorithm generates a valid path for the player through the graph. The path must begin at the start node, include the target node, and end at the exit node. It ensures that the path is a valid traversal, meaning each pair of consecutive nodes in the path is connected by an edge. The algorithm uses two while loops, the first to traverse nodes until it reaches the target node, and the second
to traverse nodes until it reaches the exit node.

Statistic Added to Scoreboard
A new statistic has been added to the scoreboard that tracks the number of unique nodes visited by each player. This statistic is the
mathematical set of nodes visited, meaning visiting a node more than once is ignored to prevent duplicates.
